# 24GHz-controller
This is a RS485 based telemetrie controller for my 24GHz transverter.
The transverter is mounted on an antennea pole. To allow remote measurement of voltage, current and  transmit power (forward voltage on reflectometer) this controller is used.
It also uses a BNO55 sensor for direction measurement. (This sensor need a life calibration after power up, requiring a 3 degree of freedom movement, which can not performed on the pole. Here i need more ideas). I found this ideas here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BNO055/tree/master/examples/restore_offsets many thanks for this code!
